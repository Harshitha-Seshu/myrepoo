## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a recent MSc Economics graduate who loves digging into data, building models, and uncovering patterns. I work with Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to turn numbers into insights.

When I'm not working with data, you'll likely find me curled up with a gripping novel, chasing plot twists. Lately, I've been lost in the world of Shatter Me, where unexpected twists keep you on your toes, reminding me to stay curious even when tackling new data. 

Hit me up if you're a fellow bookworm or have killer trading strategies!
